=========================

Contains the MS Keyboard Layout Creator source file for Programmer Dvorak (as found on [http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/](http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/)).

How is this better than the Windows driver that he provides?

1. I use Microsoft's Keyboard Layout Creator to make a native solution. This means that the keys of 10-key layouts will be preserved, rather than taking on the same key assignments as the number row.
2. The source file will be included. This means you will be able to customize and recompile the source to suit your needs. Note: compiling from source will require the [Keyboard Layout Creator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx) from Microsoft. With the Layout Creator, you will then be able to redistribute your modifications via installer. Pretty slick.

Feel free to create pull requests with any changes.
